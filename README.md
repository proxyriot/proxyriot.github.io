# Proxy Riot
### A Pop Guide to Privacy and Protest

Proxy Riot is a user guide to privacy and protest, particulary focused on the importance of freedom of speech as a human right. The project uses an informal language and ironic attitude—inspired by the Internet pop culture and slang—to deal with a quite difficult yet extremely important topic, trying to make it more approachable to the younger generations. The aim is to raise awareness and encourage anyone to defend their privacy and resist to mass surveillance. Because mass surveillance sucks.
